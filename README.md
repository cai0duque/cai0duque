## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on a digital platform called LearnConnet HUB that aims to facilitate access to study materials and integrate everything with my @Discord server.
- Iâ€™m studying advanced Python, Java, Web3 techniques and Discord API integration.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those involving cybersecurity and Front-End development.
- Ask me about Python, Java, or anything tech-related!
- Just so you know: I love astronomy and by just 1 decision I didn't become an astrophysicist or mathematician.

# Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React, Node.js, Docker, Django, etc.
- **Other**: API Integration, Data Analysis, Cybersecurity, etc.
